  ###### ID and Class properities  :
    -- homework 
       why id selector is applied in style even if class selector was after it in lines ?
       In CSS, the difference between applying styles to elements with an ID selector versus a class selector is based on specificity. Specificity is a set of rules that determine which styles should be applied to an element when conflicting rules exist.

1. **ID Selector (`#id`) Specificity**: An ID selector is highly specific. It has a higher specificity value than a class selector, which means it takes precedence over class selectors. If you apply a style to an element using its ID, that style will override any conflicting styles applied with class selectors.

2. **Class Selector (`.class`) Specificity**: Class selectors are less specific compared to ID selectors. When both ID and class selectors target the same element, the ID selector's styles will take precedence.
